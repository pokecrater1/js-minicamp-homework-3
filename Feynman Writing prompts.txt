Feynman Writing Prompts
Objects - something that can hold info and methods
properties - like the denotation for property, can invoke methods
methods - a set of action(s) an object can perform
for in loop: like a for-each loop in java, go in an object and iterate over its properties
dot notation is used for defined properties, bracket is for abstract(possibly non-existent properties)
so it may have to be created using a variable.
